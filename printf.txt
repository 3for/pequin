The printf function is available for use in verifiable computations for
debugging purposes. Using printf in a verifiable computation causes the
compiler to emit at PRINTF statement in the prover worksheet, which the prover
interprets when solving the constraints.

The implementation has the following limitations:

- All printf calls will always be printed, even if they are in conditionals
  which resolve to false at runtime. The execption is conditionals which can
  be resolved to false at compile time.

- printf accepts up to 10 arguments.

- The %Zd format specifier should be used for all integer types. (When solving
  the constraints, the prover uses arbitrary precision integers for all types
  and Pepper's printf is implemented by passing these directly to gmp's
  printf.)
